Hello! This website is aimed at discussing planning issues in Westminster. Infrastructure releases cover any construction projects that impact the design of Westminster's streets and cityscape. Main releases are long publications regarding planning-related issues in Westminster. This website has no affiliation with the City of Westminster nor its planning and engineering department. To clear up any confusion: this website was intentionally designed to look outdated (a minimalistic, corporate design is being avoided here).

Please do not contact me using my personal e-mail address regarding this website. Use "contact@cityplanninginwestminster.org" instead (this e-mail address can also be found on the website footer).

All content on this website, including code and images, are original and copyright-protected. Reuse or reproduction without written permission (e.g. a document) is prohibited.
