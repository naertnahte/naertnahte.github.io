                    <h3>Minutes and transcription</h3>
                    <p>
                        21. August 2026<br/><br/>
                    </p>
                    <h3>Preface/background</h3>
                    <p>In the 2022 California general midterms, Westminster had three positions on the city council up for election: mayor, councilmember for District 1, and councilmember for District 4. Chi Charlie Nguyen (Republican), who was first elected as councilmember in 2018, was elected as mayor, while Nam-Quan Nguyen (Republican) won the seat for District 4. In the race for the seat for District 1, Amy Phan-West (Republican) won by only 21 votes against John Gentile – the turnout for the district was 6.359 votes. While the city has had some rocky council meetings in the past, this election marked the start of a tumultuous and turbulent chapter for the city’s politics.<br/><br/>
                        
                    In the court filing, the councilwoman and councilmember Nguyen are accused of "repeatedly disrupt[ing] meetings of the Westminster City Council" in violation of multiple codes.<br/></p>

                    <blockquote>"…the City Council has ended meetings without accomplishing its business, met late into the night, and generally frustrated those interested in responsible, effective conduct of City meetings. Defendants' actions impair the rights of others who wish to be heard at City Council meetings, from council members and staff to business owners and residents."</blockquote>

                    <p>The cause of action is as follows:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>1.	Violation of Government Code § 36813, 54957.95, and Westminster Municipal Code § 2.04.060</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Gov’t code § 36813:</b> "The Council may establish rules for the conduct of its proceedings. It may punish a member or other person for disorderly behavior at a meeting." </li>
                            <li><b>Gov’t code § 54957.95</b></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>(a)(1)</b> "…the presiding member of the legislative body conducting a meeting or their designee may remove, or cause the removal of, an individual for disrupting the meeting."</li>
                                <li><b>(a)(2)</b> "…the presiding member…shall warn the individual that their behaviour is disrupting the meeting and that their failure to cease their behaviour may result in their removal. The presiding member…may then remove the individual if they do not promptly cease their disruptive behavior…"</li>
                                <li><b>(b)(1)</b> "'Disrupting' means engaging in behavior during a meeting of a legislative body that actually disrupts, disturbs, impedes, or renders infeasible the orderly conduct of the meeting…"</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li><b>WMC § 2.04.060:</b> "…any person who persistently interrupts the proceedings of the council, or refuses to be seated or keep quiet when ordered to do so by the presiding officer, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor."</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The timeline leading up to the cause of action is as follows:</p>
